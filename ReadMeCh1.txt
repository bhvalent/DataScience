I have data about two Towers. The data is in a csv file
containing seconds, amplitude, and frequency in their respective
columns.  Each tower is on a different frequency.  One 
of them is broken so I have to figure out with one it is
using the graphing functions and then graph the tower
that is working correctly.  

I open the file and make the data usable by turning it
into a list of lists and then I separate the data by tower.
I also separate the seconds and amplitudes accordingly by tower
so I can graph them. 

In the end the graph should look like a sine curve with a average 
amplitude line going through the data.
